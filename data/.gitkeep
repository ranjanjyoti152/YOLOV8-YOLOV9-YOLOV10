# Data Directory

This directory is for storing datasets and data-related files.

## Structure
- Place your COCO, custom datasets, or other training data here
- Use the `prepare_data.py` script to download and prepare datasets

Files in this directory are gitignored by default to avoid committing large dataset files.
